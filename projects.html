                    1. The target of the project is to find out which Startup will be worthful to invest and which are the upcoming ones for ad 
                    campaigns with the help of Exploratory Data Analysis.<br>
                    2. The dataset used in here is imported from Kaggle. It contains an up-to-date data from 2012 till 2022, as of June 2023.<br>
                    3. To begin with EDA, the first step is performed with <b>data cleaning</b> to check any blanks, duplicates or null values.<br>
                    4. Insights are drawn with Pivot tables and charts, hence to develop a model. Following are the insights drawn from the analysis: 
                    <div class=list><li>The first chart relates with Company, Entry valuation and Current valuation. It is drawn that companies which have the highest current
                        valuation have entered the Unicorn with entry valuation of $1B. </li>
                    <li>The second chart tells that the company that has acquired the maximum current valuation of $37.6B till June 2023, has entered the Unicorn
                        in 2012. The 2015 and 2018 companies are also succeeding the stack.</li>
                    <li>The third chart tells that the maximum current valuated companies are from Bangaluru, Bangaluru/Singapore, Gurgaon, Mumbai and Noida.</li>
                    <li>In the last chart it is observed that sectors like E-commerce, Edtech and Fintech are having the highest current valuated companies.</li></div><br>
                    5. From the insights, a model is developed and interpreted that Flipkart is acing the model. However, Byjus is the fastest growing startups which
                    has entered the Unicorn in 2018 and within 4 years it has acquired the second highest current valuation. These startups are good for investment and ad campaigns.<br>
                    6. Lastly, a dashboard to visualize a quick glance to finalize a decision whether investment or ad campaigning will be a right choice.

                    <p><b>Description</b><br>
                    1. The target of the project is to predict the price of the laptops from the existing price with the help of Multivariate Analysis.<br>
                    2. It is a Kaggle dataset that provides comprehensive collection of laptop attributes and features.<br>
                    3. The analysis starts with importing data to Jupyter Notebook and a preprocessing followed by an EDA.<br>
                    4. To build a model for linear regression, all unwanted columns are removed and an attribute is chosen based on the graph for the prediction.<br>
                    5. The data is then splitted into training and test sets and the linear regression analysis is performed.<br>
                    6. The result is drawn and a regression line is plotted that says the laptop price will increase linearly within price range 10 to 11 in Y-axis and weight range 
                    1.0 - 3.5 in X-axis. The graph shows a small break in the line that again rises linearly.
